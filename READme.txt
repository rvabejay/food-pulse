Project Name: Food Pulse AppGroup Members:Abejay, Rhys AllenAtayde, Patrick Josh Cedillo, Kevin LesterThe Food Pulse app is a simplified version of a food review app, where a user can add, update, and delete and search food reviews, food items, and food establishments through a command line interface in Python that is connected to a MariaDB database. The app contains the following features such as adding, updating, and deleting food reviews on food items or a food establishment, adding deleting, searching, and updating a food establishment, and adding, deleting, updating, and searching a food item. To use the food review system, first, unzip the CMSC127-FinalPorj.zip file containing the FoodPulse.py source code, a datadump.sql dump file with dummy data, and this READme file with instructions on how to run the program.Before running the files, make sure that you have both Python and MariaDB installed. If not, you can download the latest versions of Python and MariaDB using these links:https://www.python.org/downloads/ - for Pythonhttps://mariadb.org/download/?p=mariadb&r=10.6.8&os=Linux&cpu=x86_64&pkg=tar_gz&i=systemd&m=gigenet&t=mariadb - for MariaDBVersions that are compatible to your device is available using the links.To check if you have successfully installed Python on your device by entering the ‘python’ as the command prompt in your device’s terminal and it will show the current version of Python installed.Furthermore, to check if you have successfully installed MariaDB on your device, you can enter ‘mysql -u root -p’ as the command prompt, it should ask you for a password and once entered, you can now use MariaDB.After making sure that you have both Python and MariaDB installed, go to a terminal and then go to the directory of the Python and SQL file. Note that they should be on the same directory. Use the command prompt FoodPulse.py and press enter to run and it will now allow you to try the different features of the app.
